# Light Field defined on the suface

If the scattering in the medium could be ignored (“clear air”), plenoptic function is constant in any intervals contains no objects. Knowing light field function on virtual or real two-dimensional surface let us reconstruct the whole plenoptic optic function in any point of space which is not occluded by obstacles.
